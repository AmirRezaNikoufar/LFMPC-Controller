The primary objective is to enable precise joint angle tracking while ensuring input constraint satisfaction through numerical optimization.\n\n## Methodology\n- **Dynamic Modeling:** The robot's governing dynamic equations are derived using Newton's method. Subsequently, the equations are discretized using a Taylor series expansion and expressed in state-space form.\n- **Tracking Problem Solution:** Utilizing the derived state-space equations, the tracking problem for the robotâ€™s joint angles is addressed. Lagrange functions are employed to accelerate the optimization process, and both analytical and numerical solutions are provided.\n- **Constrained Optimization:** The constrained tracking problem is solved by applying input constraints and employing numerical optimization through the `Quadprog` method.\n\n## Contents\n- `src/`: Source code implementing the dynamic model, MPC, and optimization.\n- `data/`: Sample simulation data and results.\n- `README.md`: Project documentation.\n\n## Requirements\n- Python 3.10+\n- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `cvxpy`, `quadprog`\n\n## Usage\n1. Clone the repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2dof-rehab-robot-mpc.git\n   cd 2dof-rehab-robot-mpc\n   ```\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n3. Run the simulation:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## Results\nThe implemented MPC ensures accurate tracking of the desired joint angles and maintains input constraints. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Lagrange-based optimization approach.\n\n## Citation\nIf you use this project in your research, please cite:\n```\n@misc{2dof-rehab-robot-mpc,\n  author = {Your Name},\n  title = {Model Predictive Control for a 2-DOF Rehabilitation Robot},\n  year = {2025},\n  url = {https://github.com/yourusername/2dof-rehab-robot-mpc}\n}\n```\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
